# newsboatToPocket
save newsboat/newsbeuter articles to Pocket

Requires
- mutt
- newsboat/newsbeuter
- a pocket account

Bound Newsboat `open-in-browser` to the shellscript which emails the contents of a db file which is the most recently saved article, to add@getpocket.com.

I don't know another way to pipe the links out of Newsboat/Newsbeuter besides the `open-in=browser` If you know one cool.
